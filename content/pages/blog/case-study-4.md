**SUMMARY**

This project focused on analyzing the company's revenue and the opportunities it has provided. Using data from the client, I conducted an in-depth analysis based on the specified conditions. I examined the opportunity count while considering factors such as region, opportunity stage, months, and state, along with the revenue generated.

**Note:** The client has granted permission for this report to be included in my portfolio. Additionally, the map feature is unavailable due to limitations of the free Power BI version. Thank you.
