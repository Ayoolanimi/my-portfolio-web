**SUMMARY**

This was a project about revenue and opportunities the company has offered. I was able to carry this out using the data from the client and analyze the conditions provided.

I worked on the opportunity count, putting the region, opportunity stage, months and state into consideration, as well as the opportunity count and revenue generated.

N.B: the client gave consent for this report to be published in my portfolio. Also, the map feature wouldn't work because I am on a free Power BI version. Thanks
