**SUMMARY**

This project analyzes the total sales of each product and the revenue generated, considering the countries where purchases were made. I extracted and cleaned the data through web scraping using Python libraries such as **import**, **BeautifulSoup**, and **Pandas** before transferring the refined dataset into Power BI for visualization.

**Note:** The map feature could not be utilized due to limitations of the free Power BI version, but I am well-versed in its functionality.
